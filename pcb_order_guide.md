# PCB Order Guide

## When ordering from ELECROW

https://www.elecrow.com/pcb-manufacturing.html

Use [re5-gerber.zip](https://github.com/e3w2q/re5-macropad/blob/master/re5-gerber.zip?raw=true) as the gerber file.

The dimensions are 95 x 57 mm.

The cost does not change between 5 and 10 sheets.

If the board itself is used as a framing square, I recommend  that the board thickness be a little thinner, such as 1.0mm.

Select your favorite color for resist color.

**If the board itself is used as a framing square, the surface finish is not HASL, but HASL Lead Free or Immersion gold / ENIG please choose.**
